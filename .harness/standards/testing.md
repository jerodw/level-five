# Testing Standards

- Tests live in `tests/` and run with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` (pytest lives in the project virtualenv).
- Deterministic coordinator logic (routing, state transitions, context assembly, rule enforcement) must be covered by unit tests that never invoke a model.
- Agent invocation is isolated behind `agent_runner.py` so tests can substitute a fake runner.
- A story is not complete until all existing tests pass plus the new tests written for the story.
- Tests must not weaken or skip existing assertions to pass; verification rules are immutable.
